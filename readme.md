## Building a Chatbot with OpenAI's ChatGPT API

This code is an example of building a chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT API. The chatbot interacts with users and generates responses using the OpenAI API.

## Dependencies

- `os`: The `os` module is used to set the OpenAI API key and retrieve environment variables.
- `tkinter`: The `tkinter` module provides a GUI framework for the chatbot application.
- `openai`: The `openai` module is used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- `PyPDF2`: The `PyPDF2` module is used to extract text from PDF files.

## Setup

To use this code, you need to set up the following:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
2. Set the API key by either uncommenting the line `openai.api_key = "<your_api_key>"` and replacing `<your_api_key>` with your actual API key or by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.
3. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.

## Functionality
This code provides the following functionality:

- `read_file_contents(filepath: str) -> str`: This function reads the contents of a file specified by the `filepath` parameter. It supports reading both text files and PDF files.

- `generate_response(prompt)`: This function sends a user message as a prompt to the ChatGPT API and returns the generated response.

- `send_message()`: This function is triggered when the user sends a message. It retrieves the user's input from the GUI, sends it to the ChatGPT API, and displays the user's message and the generated response in the chat history.

- GUI: The code sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` module. It creates a chat window where the user can input messages, and the chatbot responds with generated messages.

- `import_and_display_file()`: This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Import File" button. It allows the user to select a file (supported file types: all files, text files, PDF files, Markdown files, R files), reads the contents of the file using `read_file_contents()`, and displays the contents in the chat history.

## Usage

1. Set up the API key as mentioned in the "Setup" section.
2. Run the code.
3. The GUI window will appear.
4. Type a message in the input box and press Enter or click the "Send" button to send the message to the chatbot.
5. The chat history will display the user's message and the chatbot's response.
6. Optionally, click the "Import File" button to import a file and display its contents in the chat history.

Note: This code is a basic example and can be extended or modified to suit specific chatbot requirements.

## Setting an environment variable with your API key

Remember to replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key. This will create a new environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

For Windows, open a Command Prompt and run the following command:

```cmd
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key"
```

For Mac or Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key'" >> >> ~/.zshrc
```

1. In the Python code, use the `os` library to access the environment variable:

First, import the `os` library at the beginning of the code:

```python
import os
```

Then, replace the line where you set the API key with the following:

```python
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

This code will fetch the value of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and assign it to `openai.api_key`.

By using environment variables, you can avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in your code, making it more secure and easier to manage. Remember to never share your API key or include it in publicly accessible code repositories.
